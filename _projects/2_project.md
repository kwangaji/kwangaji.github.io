South Korea has undergone one of the most remarkable economic transformations of the past 60 years. After the Korean War in the 1950s devastated the country, most citizens faced desperate poverty, lacking food, basic resources, and proper housing. Today, however, South Korea is the 4th largest economy in Asia and the 12th largest in the world—a nation known for its extraordinary rise from extreme poverty to a high-income society within just a few generations.

This film shifts the focus to the stories that were often overlooked during that rapid growth: the everyday lives of ordinary people in the 1970s whose most urgent goal was not building skyscrapers, but simply feeding their hungry children.

Feeling too hungry to stay in school, Jun skips school and wanders around her neighborhood with her best friend, Hyuk. Together, they observe how people cling onto life but they also realize how simple it is too die. The film portrays the young girl's confusion as she tries to understand what life and death means.
